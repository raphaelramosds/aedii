# Algorithms and Data Structure II

## Author

I am Raphael Ramos da Silva, a web system developer technician and undergraduating student at Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte.

## About this repository

This is a repository for tracking assignments from the Algorithms and Data Structures II course, offered by the Department of Computer Engineering and Automation (DCA) of the Technology Center (CT) at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN).

> The DCA aims to train professionals capable of designing and developing computer systems for industrial automation, embedded systems, software systems, distributed systems, computer networks, and information systems. The CT offers undergraduate and graduate courses in Engineering. This course is part of the curriculum of the Computer Engineering program at DCA/UFRN.

## Weeks

This course is organized in weeks. There is an assigment for each week.

### Week 2

- [![Open in PDF](https://img.shields.io/badge/-PDF-EC1C24?style=flat-square&logo=adobeacrobatreader)](https://github.com/ivanovitchm/datastructure/tree/main/lessons/week_02/week_02.pdf) **Review:** topics covered include Recursion, Binary Search Trees (BST), and AVL Trees.
- ðŸŽ¯ Week Goals 
    - Your main goal for this week is related to following subjects: recursion, binary and avl trees. By the conclusion, you'll have the ability to distinguish between iteration and recursion, learn how to construct and query datasets using Binary Search Trees (BST) and get acquaninted with AVL trees.
