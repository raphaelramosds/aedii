gnu general public license version 3 29 june 2007 copyright c 2007 free software foundation inc httpsfsforg everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document but changing it is not allowed preamble the gnu general public license is free copyleft license software and other kinds of works the licenses most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works by contrast the gnu general public license is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of programto make sure it remains free software all its users we the free software foundation use the gnu general public license most of our software it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors you can apply it to your programs too when we speak of free software we are referring to freedom not price our general public licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software and charge them if you wish that you receive source code or can get it if you want it that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs and that you know you can these things to protect your rights we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights therefore you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software or if you modify it responsibilities to respect the freedom of others example if you distribute copies of such program whether gratis or fee you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received you must make sure that they too receive or can get the source code and you must show them these terms so they know their rights developers that use the gnu gpl protect your rights with two steps 1 assert copyright on the software and 2 offer you this license giving you legal permission to copy distribute andor modify it the developers and authors protection the gpl clearly explains that there is warranty this free software both users and authors sake the gpl requires that modified versions be marked changed so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them although the manufacturer can so this is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users freedom to change the software the systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products individuals to use which is precisely where it is most unacceptable therefore we have designed this version of the gpl to prohibit the practice those products if such problems arise substantially in other domains we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the gpl needed to protect the freedom of users finally every program is threatened constantly by software patents states should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on generalpurpose computers but in those that we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to free program could make it effectively proprietary to prevent this the gpl assures that patents cannot be used to render the program nonfree the precise terms and conditions copying distribution and modification follow terms and conditions 0 definitions this license refers to version 3 of the gnu general public license copyright also means copyrightlike laws that apply to other kinds of works such semiconductor masks the program refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this license each licensee is addressed you licensees and recipients may be individuals or organizations to modify work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in fashion requiring copyright permission other than the making of an exact copy the resulting work is called modified version of the earlier work or work based on the earlier work covered work means either the unmodified program or work based on the program to propagate work means to anything with it that without permission would make you directly or secondarily liable infringement under applicable copyright law except executing it on computer or modifying private copy propagation includes copying distribution with or without modification making available to the public and in some countries other activities well to convey work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies mere interaction with user through computer network with transfer of copy is not conveying an interactive user interface displays appropriate legal notices to the extent that it includes convenient and prominently visible feature that 1 displays an appropriate copyright notice and 2 tells the user that there is warranty the work except to the extent that warranties are provided that licensees may convey the work under this license and how to view copy of this license if the interface presents list of user commands or options such menu prominent item in the list meets this criterion 1 source code the source code work means the preferred form of the work making modifications to it object code means any nonsource form of work standard interface means an interface that either is an official standard defined by recognized standards body or in the case of interfaces specified particular programming language one that is widely used among developers working in that language the system libraries of an executable work include anything other than the work whole that is included in the normal form of packaging major component but which is not part of that major component and b serves only to enable use of the work with that major component or to implement standard interface which an implementation is available to the public in source code form major component in this context means major essential component kernel window system and so on of the specific operating system if any on which the executable work runs or compiler used to produce the work or an object code interpreter used to run it the corresponding source work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate install and an executable work run the object code and to modify the work including scripts to control those activities however it does not include the works system libraries or generalpurpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work example corresponding source includes interface definition files associated with source files the work and the source code shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require such by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work the corresponding source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the corresponding source the corresponding source work in source code form is that same work 2 basic permissions all rights granted under this license are granted the term of copyright on the program and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met this license explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified program the output from running covered work is covered by this license only if the output given its content constitutes covered work this license acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent provided by copyright law you may make run and propagate covered works that you not convey without conditions so long your license otherwise remains in force you may convey covered works to others the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively you or provide you with facilities running those works provided that you comply with the terms of this license in conveying all material which you not control copyright those thus making or running the covered works you must so exclusively on your behalf under your direction and control on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below sublicensing is not allowed section 10 makes it unnecessary 3 protecting users legal rights from anticircumvention law covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the wipo copyright treaty adopted on 20 december 1996 or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures when you convey covered work you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this license with respect to the covered work and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work means of enforcing against the works users your or third parties legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures 4 conveying verbatim copies you may convey verbatim copies of the programs source code you receive it in any medium provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice keep intact all notices stating that this license and any nonpermissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty and give all recipients copy of this license along with the program you may charge any price or price each copy that you convey and you may offer support or warranty protection fee 5 conveying modified source versions you may convey work based on the program or the modifications to produce it from the program in the form of source code under the terms of section 4 provided that you also meet all of these conditions the work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it and giving relevant date b the work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this license and any conditions added under section 7 this requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to keep intact all notices c you must license the entire work whole under this license to anyone who comes into possession of copy this license will therefore apply along with any applicable section 7 additional terms to the whole of the work and all its parts regardless of how they are packaged this license gives permission to license the work in any other way but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it d if the work has interactive user interfaces each must display appropriate legal notices however if the program has interactive interfaces that not display appropriate legal notices your work need not make them so compilation of covered work with other separate and independent works which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work and which are not combined with it such to form larger program in or on volume of storage or distribution medium is called an aggregate if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilations users beyond what the individual works permit inclusion of covered work in an aggregate does not cause this license to apply to the other parts of the aggregate 6 conveying nonsource forms you may convey covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5 provided that you also convey the machinereadable corresponding source under the terms of this license in one of these ways convey the object code in or embodied in physical product including physical distribution medium accompanied by the corresponding source fixed on durable physical medium customarily used software interchange b convey the object code in or embodied in physical product including physical distribution medium accompanied by written offer valid at least three years and valid long you offer spare parts or customer support that product model to give anyone who possesses the object code either 1 copy of the corresponding source all the software in the product that is covered by this license on durable physical medium customarily used software interchange price more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source or 2 access to copy the corresponding source from network server at charge c convey individual copies of the object code with copy of the written offer to provide the corresponding source this alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially and only if you received the object code with such an offer in accord with subsection 6b d convey the object code by offering access from designated place gratis or charge and offer equivalent access to the corresponding source in the same way through the same place at further charge you need not require recipients to copy the corresponding source along with the object code if the place to copy the object code is network server the corresponding source may be on different server operated by you or third party that supports equivalent copying facilities provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the corresponding source regardless of what server hosts the corresponding source you remain obligated to ensure that it is available long needed to satisfy these requirements convey the object code using peertopeer transmission provided you inform other peers where the object code and corresponding source of the work are being offered to the general public at charge under subsection 6d separable portion of the object code whose source code is excluded from the corresponding source system library need not be included in conveying the object code work user product is either 1 consumer product which means any tangible personal property which is normally used personal family or household purposes or 2 anything designed or sold incorporation into dwelling in determining whether product is consumer product doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage particular product received by particular user normally used refers to typical or common use of that class of product regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses or expects or is expected to use the product product is consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial industrial or nonconsumer uses unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product installation information user product means any methods procedures authorization keys or other information required to install and execute modified versions of covered work in that user product from modified version of its corresponding source the information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made if you convey an object code work under this section in or with or specifically use in user product and the conveying occurs part of transaction in which the right of possession and use of the user product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or fixed term regardless of how the transaction is characterized the corresponding source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the installation information but this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the user product example the work has been installed in rom the requirement to provide installation information does not include requirement to continue to provide support service warranty or updates work that has been modified or installed by the recipient or the user product in which it has been modified or installed access to network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols communication across the network corresponding source conveyed and installation information provided in accord with this section must be in format that is publicly documented and with an implementation available to the public in source code form and must require special password or key unpacking reading or copying 7 additional terms additional permissions are terms that supplement the terms of this license by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions additional permissions that are applicable to the entire program shall be treated though they were included in this license to the extent that they are valid under applicable law if additional permissions apply only to part of the program that part may be used separately under those permissions but the entire program remains governed by this license without regard to the additional permissions when you convey copy of covered work you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy or from any part of it additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work you may place additional permissions on material added by you to covered work which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission notwithstanding any other provision of this license material you add to covered work you may if authorized by the copyright holders of that material supplement the terms of this license with terms disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this license or b requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the appropriate legal notices displayed by works containing it or c prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways different from the original version or d limiting the use publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material or declining to grant rights under trademark law use of some trade names trademarks or service marks or f requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material or modified versions of it with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors all other nonpermissive additional terms are considered further restrictions within the meaning of section 10 if the program you received it or any part of it contains notice stating that it is governed by this license along with term that is further restriction you may remove that term if license document contains further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this license you may add to covered work material governed by the terms of that license document provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying if you add terms to covered work in accord with this section you must place in the relevant source files statement of the additional terms that apply to those files or notice indicating where to find the applicable terms additional terms permissive or nonpermissive may be stated in the form of separately written license or stated exceptions the above requirements apply either way 8 termination you may not propagate or modify covered work except expressly provided under this license any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void and will automatically terminate your rights under this license including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11 however if you cease all violation of this license then your license from particular copyright holder is reinstated provisionally unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license and b permanently if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation moreover your license from particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this license any work from that copyright holder and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this license if your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated you not qualify to receive new licenses the same material under section 10 9 acceptance not required having copies you are not required to accept this license in order to receive or run copy of the program ancillary propagation of covered work occurring solely consequence of using peertopeer transmission to receive copy likewise does not require acceptance however nothing other than this license grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work these actions infringe copyright if you not accept this license therefore by modifying or propagating covered work you indicate your acceptance of this license to so 10 automatic licensing of downstream recipients each time you convey covered work the recipient automatically receives license from the original licensors to run modify and propagate that work subject to this license you are not responsible enforcing compliance by third parties with this license an entity transaction is transaction transferring control of an organization or substantially all assets of one or subdividing an organization or merging organizations if propagation of covered work results from an entity transaction each party to that transaction who receives copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the partys predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph plus right to possession of the corresponding source of the work from the predecessor in interest if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts you may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this license example you may not impose license fee royalty or other charge exercise of rights granted under this license and you may not initiate litigation including crossclaim or counterclaim in lawsuit alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making using selling offering sale or importing the program or any portion of it 11 patents contributor is copyright holder who authorizes use under this license of the program or work on which the program is based the work thus licensed is called the contributors contributor version contributors essential patent claims are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor whether already acquired or hereafter acquired that would be infringed by some manner permitted by this license of making using or selling its contributor version but not include claims that would be infringed only consequence of further modification of the contributor version purposes of this definition control includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in manner consistent with the requirements of this license each contributor grants you nonexclusive worldwide royaltyfree patent license under the contributors essential patent claims to make use sell offer sale import and otherwise run modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version in the following three paragraphs patent license is any express agreement or commitment however denominated not to enforce patent such an express permission to practice patent or covenant not to sue patent infringement to grant such patent license to party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce patent against the party if you convey covered work knowingly relying on patent license and the corresponding source of the work is not available anyone to copy free of charge and under the terms of this license through publicly available network server or other readily accessible means then you must either 1 cause the corresponding source to be so available or 2 arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license this particular work or 3 arrange in manner consistent with the requirements of this license to extend the patent license to downstream recipients knowingly relying means you have actual knowledge that but the patent license your conveying the covered work in country or your recipients use of the covered work in country would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid if pursuant to or in connection with single transaction or arrangement you convey or propagate by procuring conveyance of covered work and grant patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use propagate modify or convey specific copy of the covered work then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it patent license is discriminatory if it does not include within the scope of its coverage prohibits the exercise of or is conditioned on the nonexercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this license you may not convey covered work if you are party to an arrangement with third party that is in the business of distributing software under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work and under which the third party grants to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you discriminatory patent license in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you or copies made from those copies or b primarily and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work unless you entered into that arrangement or that patent license was granted prior to 28 march 2007 nothing in this license shall be construed excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law 12 surrender of others freedom if conditions are imposed on you whether by court order agreement or otherwise that contradict the conditions of this license they not excuse you from the conditions of this license if you cannot convey covered work so to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license and any other pertinent obligations then consequence you may not convey it at all example if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect royalty further conveying from those to whom you convey the program the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this license would be to refrain entirely from conveying the program 13 use with the gnu affero general public license notwithstanding any other provision of this license you have permission to link or combine any covered work with work licensed under version 3 of the gnu affero general public license into single combined work and to convey the resulting work the terms of this license will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work but the special requirements of the gnu affero general public license section 13 concerning interaction through network will apply to the combination such 14 revised versions of this license the free software foundation may publish revised andor new versions of the gnu general public license from time to time such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns each version is given distinguishing version number if the program specifies that certain numbered version of the gnu general public license or any later version applies to it you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the free software foundation if the program does not specify version number of the gnu general public license you may choose any version ever published by the free software foundation if the program specifies that proxy can decide which future versions of the gnu general public license can be used that proxys public statement of acceptance of version permanently authorizes you to choose that version the program later license versions may give you additional or different permissions however additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder result of your choosing to follow later version 15 disclaimer of warranty there is warranty the program to the extent permitted by applicable law except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders andor other parties provide the program is without warranty of any kind either expressed or implied including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness particular purpose the entire risk to the quality and performance of the program is with you should the program prove defective you assume the cost of all necessary servicing repair or correction 16 limitation of liability in event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder or any other party who modifies andor conveys the program permitted above be liable to you damages including any general special incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the program including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or failure of the program to operate with any other programs even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages 17 interpretation of sections 15 and 16 if the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the program unless warranty or assumption of liability accompanies copy of the program in return fee end of terms and conditions how to apply these terms to your new programs if you develop new program and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms to so attach the following notices to the program it is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty and each file should have at least the copyright line and pointer to where the full notice is found one line to give the programs name and brief idea of what it does copyright c year name of author this program is free software you can redistribute it andor modify it under the terms of the gnu general public license published by the free software foundation either version 3 of the license or at your option any later version this program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful but without any warranty without even the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness particular purpose see the gnu general public license more details you should have received copy of the gnu general public license along with this program if not see httpswwwgnuorglicenses also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail if the program does terminal interaction make it output short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode program copyright c year name of author this program comes with absolutely warranty details type show w this is free software and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions type show c details the hypothetical commands show w and show c should show the appropriate parts of the general public license of course your programs commands might be different gui interface you would use an about box you should also get your employer if you work programmer or school if any to sign copyright disclaimer the program if necessary more information on this and how to apply and follow the gnu gpl see httpswwwgnuorglicenses the gnu general public license does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs if your program is subroutine library you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library if this is what you want to use the gnu lesser general public license instead of this license but first please
